# TraffGen: Python flexible traffic generator

This is a library intended to make random TCP traffic generation process easier.
Using this library, we can generate certain amount of TCP byte array and send it to a selected IP address.

We can configure:
- The size of data generated by the sender
- The destination of the data receiver
- How many times should the Sender perform sending data
- How long should the Sender wait between 2 successive data sending

This library consists of 2 classes:
- Sender    : The main module will use this class if it run using "Client" Mode
- Receiver  : This will used when we run the module in "Server" mode

Usage
----

To run as a Server/Receiver and RECEIVE data:
```sh
python traffgen.py --server true
```
**Parameters:**
* server | "true" or any or not specified | Run as a Receiver if "true", as Sender otherwise

To run as a Client/Sender and SENDING data:
```sh
python traffgen.py --server_ip 127.0.0.1 --data_size 1024 --send_count 10 --sleep 1
```
**Parameters:**
* server_ip  | "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" | This is the Receiver address
* data_size  | <a number> | This is the size of the data to sent to the Server
* send_count | <a number> | How many time the client should send the data before it shuts
* sleep      | <a number> | How many seconds the client should should wait after it each time it successfully send the data
